# HoverBoard-Effect
A hoverboard effect is a web-based project. The hoverboard effect project has a cool effect of painting on a box by hovering over it. It is created by using HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3.

In this project, we create a big square board with lots of tiny square boxes on it. We have colored those small square boxes If the mouse cursor goes over the big square box the small tiny square box is colored. It has a simple background big box in the middle. The user has to hover the mouse over the box and it will display a random color. It has a very cool user interface. the project make the website more attractive.
